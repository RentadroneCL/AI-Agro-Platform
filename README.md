# Developers

Help improve our software! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether to add new features, improve speed, fix existing bugs or add support. [Check our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and how decisions are made.

Any code contributions are welcomed as long as they are discussed in [Github Issues](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro-Platform/issues) with maintainers. Be aware that if you decide to change something and submit a PR on your own, it may not be accepted.

## Creating an issue

You can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request. For more information, see [the template for filling issues](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro-Platform/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)

# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro-Platform).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard.](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12)** The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle.** We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

*Happy coding!*
